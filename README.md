# 🌍 All About GitHub Licenses 🚀  

When you upload code to **GitHub**, it's important to specify a **license** so others know how they can use, modify, and distribute your work.  
Without a license, your code is **not automatically open-source**, and others may have legal restrictions when using it.

## 📜 What is a GitHub License?  
A **GitHub license** is a legal document that defines how your code can be used, modified, shared, or distributed by others.  
It ensures clarity and legal protection for both the author and the users of the project.  

### 🔥 Why Should You Add a License?  
✅ **Clarifies permissions** – Others will know whether they can use or modify your code.  
✅ **Protects your rights** – Prevents unauthorized use or legal issues.  
✅ **Encourages contributions** – Open-source projects with clear licenses attract more developers.  
✅ **Legal safety** – Avoids future disputes over ownership and liability.

## 🚀 Which License Should You Use? (Quick Guide)  

- **MIT License** – Best for most developers (✅ Permissive, widely used).  
- **Apache 2.0** – Like MIT but with **patent protection** (Great for big projects).  
- **GPL v3** – **Forces open-source** (All modifications must also be open).  
- **BSD 3-Clause** – Like MIT, but prevents the use of your name for promotion.  
- **Unlicense** – **No restrictions**, public domain.  

### ⚡ For Your Project, I Recommend:  
✅ **MIT License** – It's simple, flexible, and allows others to use your code while crediting you.
